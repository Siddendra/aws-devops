Understanding Kubernetes Fundamentals

1.1 EKS vs. Self-Managed Kubernetes: Pros and Cons

1.1.1 EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service)

Pros:

Managed Control Plane: AWS handles upgrades, patches, and ensures high availability of control plane components.

Automated Updates: Keeps Kubernetes version updated.

Scalability: Automatically scales based on demand.

AWS Integration: IAM, VPC, Load Balancers, etc.

Security and Compliance: Meets major security standards.

Monitoring and Logging: Integrates with CloudWatch.

Ecosystem Support: Backed by AWS and Kubernetes community.

Cons:

Cost: More expensive than self-managed alternatives.

Less Control: Limited customization of control plane.

1.1.2 Self-Managed Kubernetes on EC2 Instances

Pros:

Cost-Effective: Can use spot/reserved EC2 instances.

Flexibility: Full control over configuration.

EKS-Compatible: Still uses AWS integrations.

Experimental Features: Use cutting-edge Kubernetes features.

Cons:

Complexity: Manual setup and management.

Maintenance Overhead: Manual patching and upgrades.

Scaling Challenges: Must plan and implement scaling.

Security Responsibility: Additional setup required.

Manual Operations: More scripts and processes.

Setting up your AWS Environment for EKS

2.1 Creating an AWS Account and Setting up IAM Users

Create an AWS Account: Go to aws.amazon.com and register.

Access AWS Console: Verify email and sign in.

Enable MFA (Optional): Enhances account security.

Create IAM Users: Go to IAM > Add User > Set access type and permissions.

Access Keys: Store Access Key ID and Secret Access Key securely.

2.2 Configuring the AWS CLI and kubectl

Install AWS CLI: Follow AWS CLI installation guide.

Configure CLI:

aws configure

Enter credentials, region, and output format.

Install kubectl: Refer to kubectl installation.

Configure kubectl for EKS:

aws eks update-kubeconfig --name your-cluster-name
kubectl get nodes

2.3 Preparing Networking and Security Groups for EKS

1. Create a VPC:

Use VPC service in AWS Console.

Create public and private subnets.

2. Configure Security Groups:

Go to VPC > Security Groups > Create.

Define Inbound/Outbound rules.

Attach Security Group ID to worker nodes.

3. Set Up Internet Gateway (IGW):

Create IGW from VPC > Internet Gateways.

Attach to your VPC.

Update route table with destination 0.0.0.0/0 to point to IGW.

4. Configure IAM Policies:

Create custom IAM policy with permissions for EKS, EC2, ELB, ECR, etc.

Attach policy to IAM roles.

Use this IAM role when launching worker nodes.

With these steps, your AWS environment is ready to launch and manage EKS clusters.
